# OpenStack Sample Configs

This is a simple repo that I use to generate sample configs for OpenStack Services.

Right now it does nova, cinder, and glance. 

Heat is broken: https://bugs.launchpad.net/heat/+bug/1412571

I cannot get nova to work on the juno branch.

## To Do:
 - neutron
 - swift?
 - designate
 - ceilometer
