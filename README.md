# OpenStack Sample Configs

This is a simple repo that I use to generate sample configs for OpenStack Services.

This is mainly so that I can be lazy when looking up new/changed options.

## To Do:
 - swift?

## Issues:
 - support branches (stable/juno etc)
 - 0 byte files will get checked in if the build fails
